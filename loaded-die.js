// However, instead of a random die, we want to create a cheat die that would let us predict the next number. Create a function called makeLoadedDie() which returns a function that when called, seems to generate random numbers between 1 and 6, but in fact returns numbers in a row from a hardcoded list.

function makeLoadedDie() {
  var list = [5, 4, 6, 1, 6, 4, 2, 3, 3, 5];
  var counter = 0;

  return function() {
    for (var i = counter; i < list.length; i ++) {
      counter ++;
      return list[i];
    }
  }
}

var rollLoadedDie = makeLoadedDie();

console.log(rollLoadedDie());  // 5
console.log(rollLoadedDie());  // 4
console.log(rollLoadedDie());  // 6
